# Patient Health Management System

The purpose of the database is to provide a patient-centered healthcare system to the hospitals that facilitate monitoring and improvement of their services. We achieve that by maintaining the medical history of patients, analyzing their symptoms, diagnosis, medications, and providing a seamless billing experience.
